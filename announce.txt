Little CMS intends to be a small-footprint color management engine,
with special focus on accuracy and performance.  It uses the
International Color Consortium standard (ICC), which is the modern
standard when regarding to color management.  The ICC specification is
widely used and is referred to in many International and other
de-facto standards.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.
